<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm someone who values precision and creativity, whether itâ€™s crafting concise solutions, exploring 
  software engineering as part of my ICT studies, gaming with a Long Sword in Monster Hunter: World, or 
  improving my fitness with steady progress. I enjoy challenges and have a knack for blending practicality with 
  fun in everything I do.
